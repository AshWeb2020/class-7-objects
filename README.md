# Example Code for Class #7 of Ashesi Web Development 2020

This is example code used to illustrate object inheritance and composition in Ashesi Web Development 2020

## Running the code

This code was designed to run under a version of node support es6 modules. We include appropriate things so vscode can debug it as well. It is not dependent on any node_modules and can be directly run.   After cloning the repository to a directory; load the directory in vscode.

You can debug (step through) the program in VScode by choosing from the debug pane (button on the left of VSCode with bug and triangle) "Launch Program" and pick the platform
you are on:  Windows or Linux, Mac, WSL.
